But let&#8217;s be honest, it&#8217;s probably a combination of all three of those things.<\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<p>But fear not, the answer to our problems can be found in the simplest of changes to our lifestyle. Here are some easy things you can implement into your days and evenings to ensure that you wake up feeling as refreshed as possible every morning.<\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<h2>Leave your mobile phone outside of the bedroom<\/h2>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<p>I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve already heard time and again that the light from your phone screen keeps you awake for longer. By staring at your phone screen you are essentially absorbing a &#8216;stream of photons&#8217;, telling your brain to stay awake.<\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<p>It may seem simple and quick ticking off all the notifications on your apps before bed and checking for any new emails you may have missed, but it&#8217;s keeping your brain awake. It tells your brain that it&#8217;s not time to sleep yet so your brain won&#8217;t secrete melatonin (the hormone that makes you sleepy).<\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<p>Aside from spending your wind-down time on your phone preventing you from falling asleep, studies have found it is also affecting relationships. Instead of talking before falling asleep, couples are lying on their phones. So put down your phone and feel the benefits to both your health and your relationship.<\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sleepiest.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/sleep-phone-1-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-772\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.sleepiest.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/sleep-phone-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.sleepiest.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/sleep-phone-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.sleepiest.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/sleep-phone-1-768x513.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.sleepiest.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/sleep-phone-1.jpg 1260w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<h2>Resist hitting &#8216;snooze&#8217;<\/h2>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<p>When your alarm goes off in a morning, hitting snooze may feel like the most appealing thing to do, but it is actually not helping you feel more refreshed. When you &#8216;snooze off&#8217; for an extra 5 or 10 minutes, you&#8217;re actually then waking yourself up in the middle of a sleep cycle once your alarm goes off again.<\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<p>Instead of hitting <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sleepiest.com\/sleep-tips-and-tricks\/hitting-snooze-sleep-quality\/\">snooze<\/a>, make sure that you&#8217;re going to bed a bit earlier on an evening to feel more awake in a morning.<\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sleepiest.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/wake-up-alarm.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-774\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.sleepiest.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/wake-up-alarm.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.sleepiest.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/wake-up-alarm-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.sleepiest.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/wake-up-alarm-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<h2>Get your optimum hours of sleep<\/h2>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<p>On the subject of getting enough sleep on an evening \u2013 are you getting enough hours each night?<\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<p>The optimum number of hours an adult should be getting each night are between 7-9 hours. So if you need to wake up at 7am, make sure you&#8217;re giving yourself enough time to be asleep by at least midnight \u2013 and that means going to bed earlier so you have time to wind down.<\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<h2>Refrain from caffeine in the afternoon<\/h2>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<p>We all know that caffeine is a stimulant \u2013 after all, that&#8217;s exactly why we drink it!<\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<p>But drinking coffee and other caffeinated drinks later in the day could be causing you to take longer to fall asleep on an evening. Where possible, try to avoid <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sleepiest.com\/sleep-tips-and-tricks\/top-tips-to-sleep-better\/\">caffeine<\/a> on an afternoon, and especially on an evening; use it as your wake up aid in a morning. If you&#8217;re stuck in the habit of having a hot drink in the afternoon, why not switch to a decaffeinated version.<\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<p>If you are reliant on coffee to keep you going through the day then it&#8217;s probably a good idea to cut down your intake so that you&#8217;re not relying on it to keep you awake. Getting more sleep on a night could make the world of difference to your energy levels during the day.<\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sleepiest.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/wake-up-morning.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-776\" width=\"854\" height=\"540\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.sleepiest.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/wake-up-morning.jpg 854w, https:\/\/www.sleepiest.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/wake-up-morning-300x190.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.sleepiest.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/wake-up-morning-768x486.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 854px) 100vw, 854px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<h2>Leave yourself at least 2 hours in the morning<\/h2>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<p>This is one that you can do in the morning, rather than the night before, to feel truly ready to tackle the day.
