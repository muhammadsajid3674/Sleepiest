Some sufferers recall hallucinating and seeing figures around them; some even report feeling like something is sat on their chest.<\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<p>Of course, the feeling of having a tight chest could be totally down to the anxiety caused by the scary sensations of sleep paralysis. But nevertheless, it is a terrifying condition that has had people spooked throughout the centuries.<\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<p>Remember the Salem witch trials and people&#8217;s claims of alien abduction?

Even the Salem witch trials are thought to have been caused by the townspeople experiencing sleep paralysis. Of course in those days, people were more superstitious and it was easier to believe it was caused by supernatural forces&#8230;<\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<p>There are three types of experiences that people have during their sleep paralysis. These include the presence of an intruder, pressure on the chest and, sometimes, levitation or an out-of-body experience.<\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<h2>So why does sleep paralysis happen?<\/h2>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<p>Well, it&#8217;s all down to not waking up correctly from the REM (rapid eye movement) stage of sleep.<\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<p>When you enter the REM stage of sleep (the final in the sleep cycle), your body tells the muscles to relax and you go into a state of paralysis. During sleep paralysis, the eyes open and the brain starts to wake up but the body remains frozen in REM atonia. So people become alert while stuck in the stage of sleep. It can take from a few seconds to a few minutes before the paralysis subsides.<\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<p>Surprisingly, you can experience sleep paralysis whilst waking up or falling asleep. When the body has trouble transitioning between the sleep stages, that is when paralysis can happen. If you suffer from it while falling asleep it is called&nbsp;hypnagogic sleep paralysis. Alternatively, it is called&nbsp;hypnopompic sleep paralysis if it happens as you wake up.<\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<p>But while some people are so afraid of their sleep paralysis that they avoid drifting off to sleep, some people don&#8217;t mind them and even find a thrill in the experience.<\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<h2>What if I get sleep paralysis?<\/h2>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<p>Everybody has the risk of experiencing sleep paralysis any time you go to sleep; there are no concrete indicators for why it happens. People just experience it differently.<\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<p>To avoid the risk of experiencing sleep paralysis, try to get a good night&#8217;s sleep &#8211; research has shown that the fewer sleep people get, the higher their chance of experiencing sleep disorders.<\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<p>To avoid sleep disorders, try to get quality sleep each night and avoid things that affect you drifting off into a deep sleep. Factors such as drinking alcohol and eating right before bedtime can affect your quality of sleep.<\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-quote gutenberg-block\">\n <div class=\"st-post-quote-container\">\n <div class=\"st-post-quote-content\">\n <div class=\"st-quote\">\n <div class=\"st-quote-fill\"><\/div>\n <div class=\"st-quote-body\">\n <div class=\"st-quote-grid\">\n <div class=\"st-quote-grid-col\">\n <div class=\"st-quote-icon\">\n <svg class=\"st-svgsprite -quote\">\n                                                <use\n xlink:href=\"\/assets\/img\/sprites\/svgsprites.svg#quote\"><\/use>\n                                            <\/svg>\n                                        <\/div>\n                                    <\/div>\n <div class=\"st-quote-grid-col\"><div class=\"st-quote-text\"><p>Research has shown that sleep paralysis is not dangerous.

There is nothing else in the room with you and you haven&#8217;t died (as some people claim they feel). When you&#8217;re able, try to wiggle your toes and fingers gently; it will gradually help to warm up your muscles and urge them to kick into action.<\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<p>As much as there have been studies on sleep paralysis, nobody has yet found concrete evidence as to why this phenomenon happens and what can be done to prevent it.
