While it&#8217;s easier said than done to tell yourself to &#8216;stop worrying about it&#8217;, there are things you can do to try relax yourself and calm down your overactive brain.<\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<p><strong>How to fix it&#8230;<\/strong><\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<p>There are many things you could do to relax yourself, like going for a walk, lighting some candles and playing relaxing music, or meditating.<\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<p>But studies have shown that one of the best things you can do before going to sleep with a stressful mind is by writing down the negative, stressful thoughts and then problem solve each worry. Do this a few hours before bed and come up with solutions to your problems; it will make them feel a lot more under control.<\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<p>Colleen E.

Your anxious thoughts should disappear almost immediately once you leave the room. Sounds like magic, right? This strategy is called <a href=\"http:\/\/www.intropsych.com\/ch05_conditioning\/stimulus_control.html\">stimulus control<\/a>, and it stops you from associating your bed with anxiety.<\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<h2>Going To Bed Hungry<\/h2>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<p>There&#8217;s a reason why we get hunger pangs; because our bodies need more fuel. If you go to bed on an empty stomach, your body will continue to let you know that it needs feeding throughout the night. This can lead to restless or uncomfortable sleep.<\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<p><strong>How to fix it&#8230;<\/strong><\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<p>You don&#8217;t need to eat much before bed to cure your growling stomach.

(It&#8217;s almost like a really early breakfast!) Your body then won&#8217;t have much fat to store overnight and will keep your metabolism quietly ticking over.<\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"901\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sleepiest.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/eggs-sleep.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-877\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.sleepiest.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/eggs-sleep.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.sleepiest.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/eggs-sleep-300x264.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.sleepiest.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/eggs-sleep-768x676.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<h2>You Let Your Pet Sleep In Your Bed<\/h2>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sleepiest.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/sunrise-wake-up.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-851\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.sleepiest.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/sunrise-wake-up.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.sleepiest.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/sunrise-wake-up-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.sleepiest.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/sunrise-wake-up-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<p>As nice as it is to wake up to your dog licking your face or your cat snuggled up with you, it could be causing you more harm than good.

Primary insomnia is when a person has trouble sleeping, that is not associated with other medical conditions. Secondary insomnia is where a health condition (such as asthma, body pain, depression, heartburn, alcohol etc.) is causing the sleep problem.<\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<p>Insomnia can be influenced by many external factors, such as some of the things we have already talked about in this article.<\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<p><strong>How to fix it&#8230;<\/strong><\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<p>If you are experiencing negative side effects due to chronic lack of sleep, be sure to speak to your doctor to seek out medication or therapy.<\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<h2>Your Partner Snores<\/h2>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<p>You won&#8217;t know if you snore in your sleep, but you certainly will know if your partner does. The sound of a person&#8217;s snoring can sound as loud as a chainsaw.<\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<p>Snoring can be the result of blocked airways, sleeping with your mouth open, or the tissues in the throat fluttering as you breathe.<\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<p>Covering your ears and nudging them awake can only work so long, and usually as soon as they fall back asleep it starts all over again.<\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<p><strong>How to fix it&#8230;<\/strong><\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<p>If your partner is lying on their back, try turning them over to lie on their side. This helps to reduce the obstruction of the airways. You could even try placing books under their pillows to elevate their head to put them in a better sleeping position.<\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<p>Try to avoid smoking or drinking before bed as smoking irritates the membranes of the throat and alcohol relaxes the muscles.
