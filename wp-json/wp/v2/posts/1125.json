This is particularly true for those who live a busy life, as getting a good night\u2019s rest gives the body a chance to recover from the previous day\u2019s trials and tribulations and helps maintain high focus during the busy day ahead.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<p>However, as many as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.aviva.com\/newsroom\/news-releases\/2017\/10\/Sleepless-cities-revealed-as-one-in-three-adults-suffer-from-insomnia\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">67% of adults<\/a> suffer from disrupted sleep and a quarter of Brits say that they get less than 5 hours of sleep per night. Despite this, 51% of adults fail to do anything about their poor sleep schedule and are living in a never-ending limbo of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sleepiest.com\/blog\/sleep-deprivation-the-long-lasting-affects-on-your-mental-physical-health\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">sleep deprivation<\/a> and fatigue.\u00a0<\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<p>There are many reasons why we struggle to sleep. But, underlying most of them is the busyness of our modern lives.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<p>Unlike our ancestors, who worked between the rising and setting of the sun, we can extend our workdays and prolong productivity well into the night. We also have access to a constant feed of news and opinion through blue-light emitting phones that wreak havoc with our sleep quality and leave us all feeling wired when we should be nodding off.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<h2>Sleep and Productivity<\/h2>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<p>Most people can\u2019t remember the last time they got to work and felt energised. Rather, most people start the day by reaching for the coffee pot and wiping the sleep from their eyes. But what if it didn\u2019t have to be this way \u2014 what if better sleep could help <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sleepiest.com\/blog\/wake-up-feeling-refreshed-every-morning-with-these-simple-tips\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">improve our energy in the morning<\/a> and raise our productivity throughout the day?<\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<p>Well, <a href=\"https:\/\/journals.sagepub.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1177\/0890117117722517\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">research shows<\/a> that those who get a healthy 7-9 hours of sleep per night are actually more productive than their peers who stay up working into the night. Additionally, folks who get enough sleep benefit from having a stronger immune system and are less likely to miss work due to illness.\u00a0<\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<p>This suggests that, despite the temptation to burn the midnight oil, the best approach to a busy life is to prioritise sleep. When we get enough sleep, we\u2019re unlikely to fall behind due to illness and will have an easier time navigating the pressures of modern life.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<h2>Remote Work and Routine<\/h2>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<p>Remote workers may find it particularly challenging to strike a healthy balance between work and rest. It\u2019s all too easy to log on early or check work emails before bed, but doing so can throw a person\u2019s sleep routine out the window.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<p>Remote workers are also at higher risk of developing a sleep disorder due to the nature of their work. Most remote work involves long periods of sustained focus on blue-light emitting devices like computers and many remote workers enjoy the freedom of flexible hours. This means <a href=\"https:\/\/www.frasereye.com\/8-unexpected-ways-that-remote-work-is-affecting-our-health\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">remote workers are at high risk of conditions<\/a> like shift work sleep disorder, as well as social isolation and depression. These conditions can throw busy employees\u2019 sleep quality into a tailspin and cause further health conditions down the line.\u00a0<\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<p>Fortunately, a host of tech solutions exist to help remote workers reduce the strain that blue light places on their brains and stay logged off at the end of their shift.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<p>Remote workers can start by taking advantage of system locks on computers and devices. Windows <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.microsoft.com\/en-us\/windows\/win32\/taskschd\/task-scheduler-start-page?redirectedfrom=MSDN\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">task manager<\/a> allows users to close down their computers at a set time of day and Apple\u2019s mac can be locked similarly by utilising the <a href=\"https:\/\/smallbusiness.chron.com\/lock-mac-after-closing-33780.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">security and privacy settings<\/a> to shut down at the end of the workday.\u00a0<\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<p>Additionally, remote workers can consider investing in some blue-light cancelling glasses which reduce glare and may improve focus throughout the day. If blue-light glasses aren\u2019t practical, then remote workers can make some sleep-positive changes to their routine by taking regular breaks in the evening and looking away from the screen for at least 20 seconds every 20 minutes.<\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<h3>Sleep and Health Conditions<\/h3>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<p>We\u2019ve all been guilty of working when we should be sleeping at some point in our lives. Whether it\u2019s an upcoming assignment, a daunting presentation, or simply the temptation to get a little extra work done, we have accepted the idea that cutting down on sleep can enhance productivity.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<p>However, in the long run, skipping sleep for extra work will catch up with us and cause conditions that jeopardise productivity and lead to serious conditions. That\u2019s because forgoing sleep is connected with health conditions like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.healthcentral.com\/article\/exploring-the-link-between-sleep-apnea-and-psoriasis\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis.<\/a> These kinds of conditions are brought on by increased inflammation in the body, which researchers suggest is caused by sleep conditions like sleep apnea.\u00a0<\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<p>Other conditions like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.heart.org\/en\/news\/2019\/10\/02\/sleeping-less-than-6-hours-may-raise-risk-of-cancer-even-death\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">heart disease, diabetes, and cancer<\/a> are also more common among those who fail to get more than 6 hours of sleep per night. This makes sense, as, without sleep, our bodies aren\u2019t able to adequately repair themselves after a hard day, which puts us at risk of a significant illness.\u00a0<\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<p>Poor sleep goes hand-in-hand with a busy, modern lifestyle. However, skipping sleep for extra work doesn\u2019t improve overall productivity \u2014 it just results in long-term illness, fatigue, and a drop in performance. Instead, we should all try to prioritise sleep by taking regular breaks from screens and resisting the temptation to work overtime when we should be getting ready for sleep.\u00a0<\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<h2>Still suffering with a dysfunctional sleep routine?
