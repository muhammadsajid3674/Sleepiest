It&#8217;s something we&#8217;ve all struggled with at some point in life. You always hear old wives tales of how to improve your sleeping pattern and overall relaxation. But do any of them actually work?<\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<p>Now, I&#8217;m definitely somebody who has on-off struggles with sleep deprivation. I can have nights where I sleep like a log and feel awful in the mornings and have other days where it takes me hours to get to sleep yet somehow I survive the next day.<\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sleepiest.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/sleeping-peanut.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-840\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.sleepiest.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/sleeping-peanut.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.sleepiest.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/sleeping-peanut-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.sleepiest.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/sleeping-peanut-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<p>Overall, I&#8217;d say I&#8217;m pretty bad when it comes to trying to sleep. But what can we do to help us comfortably (and quickly) reach the land of nod? Well, we have a few tips for you. When you can&#8217;t sleep, it can be a nightmare to your health. Not even mentioning your brain functionality.<\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<h4>1. Cut out visual technology<\/h4>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sleepiest.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/tv-at-night.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-889\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.sleepiest.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/tv-at-night.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.sleepiest.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/tv-at-night-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.sleepiest.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/tv-at-night-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<p>This sounds like the sort of thing that you might not think of, but it&#8217;s hard to switch your brain off when you&#8217;ve been stimulated by television, video games or your phone screen. Much like smoking, it&#8217;s a stimulant that can keep you awake and your brain active and focussed.<\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<p>Though it seems like a difficult request as most of the time we do it without thinking, it&#8217;s best to try not to go on your phone before you sleep if you can, try not to use any technology that requires focus and interaction (phones and video games) an hour before you go to bed to allow your brain to wind down.<\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<p>If you can&#8217;t sleep, cutting out TV could also be beneficial but it can also be used as a tool to calm you down.<\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<h4>2. Read a book<\/h4>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sleepiest.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/book-in-bed.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-890\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.sleepiest.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/book-in-bed.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.sleepiest.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/book-in-bed-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.sleepiest.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/book-in-bed-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<p>Now, I know in this day an age that most people don&#8217;t read books anymore, a lot of people either read blogs or online articles.<\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<p>If you&#8217;re thinking of doing that before bed &#8211; don&#8217;t! As I mentioned in the post above, digital screens can be a stimulant for your brain and you will easily be distracted from incoming Facebook notifications and tweets.<\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<p>A Kindle is a good piece of tech to read on but still, there&#8217;s nothing that beats a good book for me. Sit in bed or in an armchair with a nice reading lamp on and physically turn the pages of a novel or biography and let your brain unwind.<\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<p>I try and set myself a target, not too longwinded but enough to get you winding down. I usually aim for a chapter, if the chapters are relatively short, set yourself a target of 10 pages then end on the next convenient paragraph. This (for me) is one of the best tips to help if you can&#8217;t sleep.<\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<h4>3. Keep a notepad\/diary by the bed<\/h4>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"869\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sleepiest.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/journal-daily-bed.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-891\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.sleepiest.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/journal-daily-bed.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.sleepiest.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/journal-daily-bed-300x255.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.sleepiest.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/journal-daily-bed-768x652.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<p>This might sound like a strange one, but keep a notepad by your bed, some of your best ideas come from your subconscious. In fact, The Beatles and The Rolling Stones have both admitted to writing songs based on dreams they had.<\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<p>The problem with dreams is you can forget what you dreamt about within&nbsp;5 minutes of waking up. So what&#8217;s the best solution? Keep a notepad next to your bed so you can jot them down. That way you can look back at them in the morning, analyse them or just remember a good idea.<\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<p>It&#8217;s also good to write down every thought that comes into your head before you go to sleep, that way your mind can be at ease knowing that you&#8217;ve already written a list of things to consider for the morning.<\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<h4>4. Try and leave your work at work<\/h4>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sleepiest.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/work-in-bed.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-892\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.sleepiest.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/work-in-bed.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.sleepiest.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/work-in-bed-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.sleepiest.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/work-in-bed-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<p>Sure, this can be easier said than done, but trust me, if you can give yourself at least an hour period to wind down before bed, you will feel so much better for it.<\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<p>Try not to even think about work, as your mind goes into a frenzy worrying, planning the day, fretting about what happened yesterday.<\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<p>Being able to differentiate work from your home life is imperative to a good nights sleep. Trust me, I&#8217;ve been there. More often than not, work is fine and your anxieties are all in your head. So you ruin yourself for no good reason.<\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<p>Remember all those years when your parents would say &#8220;why have you left your essay until last minute?!&#8221; They&#8217;re correct. Not only will you not be able to produce your best, you&#8217;re also knackering your body for the next day.<\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<h4>5.
