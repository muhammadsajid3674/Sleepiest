We&#8217;ve all wished for more hours in the day, or an extra day in the week for more productivity at some point in our lives. That, unfortunately, won&#8217;t change, however, there are ways to increase your daily hours of productivity if you&#8217;re willing to make some sacrifices.<\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<p>Now, there are certain ways you can gain more hours, firstly, you could stop time-wasting with television, video games and socialising but where&#8217;s the fun in that?<\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<p>The second plan of action would be to sleep less. But would that sort of sleep deprivation take its toll on your body? Surely you couldn&#8217;t sustain a lifestyle like that for long. As it turns out, you can. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, it won&#8217;t be easy to adjust, but it&#8217;s doable.<\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<p>It&#8217;s called polyphasic sleep and it requires you limit your sleep to a minimum per day. Some people manage to go anywhere between 1-4 hours sleep per day. Allegedly, great minds in history such as; Leonardo DaVinci, Salvador Dali and Nikola Tesla (to name a few) had adapted to this method.<\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<h2>Where do I begin with Polyphasic Sleep?<\/h2>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<p>How on Earth do you manage to go from approximately 8 hours to less than 4 without breaking down? In a nutshell, you drastically reduce the hours you sleep for bedtime and add 20-30 minute naps throughout the day.<\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"802\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sleepiest.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/quick-nap.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-863\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.sleepiest.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/quick-nap.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.sleepiest.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/quick-nap-300x235.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.sleepiest.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/quick-nap-768x602.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<p>The most crucial part of the sleep, known as &#8216;rapid eye movement sleep&#8217;. It lasts 20 to 30 minutes and it&#8217;s the part that helps your brain recharge your batteries and de-stress. If you can master this, you will be able to sink so much more time into tasks rather than losing a chunk of time to a block of sleep.<\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<p>Once you can master the balance of napping, you should be able to get yourself into these quick deep-sleeps then you can use your time more effectively through the day. Just make sure you do your homework first.<\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<p>In fact, if you dare brave the challenge and give it a go yourself, why not listen to our Sleepiest soundscapes to help you drift off in your quick 20-30 minute naps? They&#8217;re the perfect way to wind down without the distraction of a story that may stimulate your brain.<\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<p>Sure, balancing it around your work schedule can be tough, but if you can get yourself to the point where you can nap through your lunch breaks, you&#8217;re well on your way to a more efficient life.<\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<h2>We have a testimony from a man who decided to give it a whirl<\/h2>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<p>One man who works for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UC4rlAVgAK0SGk-yTfe48Qpw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><em>Bright Side<\/em><\/a> decided to give the polyphasic sleep challenge a go.
