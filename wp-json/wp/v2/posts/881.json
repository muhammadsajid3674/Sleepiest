They dislike having nothing to distract themselves with or use to actively relax their whirring brains. So one of the answers to this issue could be in drifting off to sleep whilst surrounded by sounds.<\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<p>Sounds a bit odd, right? Surely we shouldn&#8217;t want any sounds to keep us awake.

I&#8217;m sure we all know someone who could sleep through an earthquake, and then another person who wakes up at the sound of a pin drop. It&#8217;s all down to how our brains react to certain sounds; whether we find them alarming or relaxing.<\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<h2>Sleep sounds could be the answer \u2013 but every person likes something different<\/h2>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<p>It&#8217;s hard to tell what sort of sounds wake us up from our slumber.
