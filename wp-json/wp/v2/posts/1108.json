This can be frustrating. The good news is that there are methods you can adopt to recall more of your dreams. It can take some practice and you may need to train your brain as you would any muscle.

After all, how can you write a journal if you can\u2019t remember what\u2019s happened? Well, it all comes down to your approach to your journaling.<\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<p><strong>Your considerations here should include:&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<ul><li><strong>When to Journal<\/strong><\/li><\/ul>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<p>You need to get into the habit of writing whatever you remember about your dreams as soon as you wake up. This isn\u2019t just about writing in a journal once you\u2019ve woken, performed your morning ablutions, and started the day. The details of your dreams will have escaped you by then. Rather, keep your journal materials next to your bed. Before you even check your phone after shutting off your alarm, write down everything you remember about your dreams. Indeed, if you wake in the night in the middle of your dream, write about this, too. The stronger this habit becomes, the more skilled you can be at recalling the details<\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<h2><strong>Prioritise High-Quality Sleep<\/strong><\/h2>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<p><\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<p>When you\u2019re unable to get a full and uninterrupted slumber, your mental, cognitive, and emotional functions tend to suffer. This, in turn, contributes to poor sleep cycles. Indeed, you may not always enter or maintain <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/www.sleepiest.com\/blog\/what-happens-during-the-5-stages-of-sleep\/\" target=\"_blank\">a rapid eye movement (REM) stage of sleep<\/a> conducive to vivid and memorable dreams. Not to mention you may be too groggy in the morning to recall your unconscious experiences. As such, it\u2019s important to prioritise achieving regular cycles of high-quality sleep.<\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<p><strong>Your focus should be on:<\/strong><\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<ul><li><strong>Your Pre-Sleep Routine<\/strong><\/li><\/ul>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<p>A consistent pre-sleep routine can be key to making sure you get the rest you need for memorable dreams.

Performing some light yoga or meditation can manage the stresses of the day or anxieties about your life. Make sure there is soft lighting in your room and try to avoid vivid colours and patterns on your bedding. Reading a book or listening to some gentle instrumental music can help your mind wind down.<\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<ul><li><strong>Your Diet<\/strong><\/li><\/ul>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<p>How you treat your body has a direct impact on the quality of sleep you can achieve. This isn\u2019t just about the adage of eating cheese causes uncomfortable dreams. There is also a strong relationship between consuming alcohol or drugs and disrupted sleep. This is because both can interfere with the chemicals in your brain that manage your sleep cycles. It might seem as though alcohol or sedatives would put you to sleep, but it is not good quality sleep. As such, it\u2019s important to cut out any stimulants or sedatives, particularly in the hours before your bedtime.<\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-style-rounded\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sleepiest.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/pexels-ron-lach-8264248-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1112\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.sleepiest.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/pexels-ron-lach-8264248-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.sleepiest.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/pexels-ron-lach-8264248-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.sleepiest.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/pexels-ron-lach-8264248-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.sleepiest.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/pexels-ron-lach-8264248-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/www.sleepiest.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/pexels-ron-lach-8264248-2048x1365.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<h2><strong>Step Outside Your Comfort Zone<\/strong><\/h2>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<p><\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<p>It may be the case that the routines of your life are not resulting in especially memorable dreams. Let\u2019s face it, it\u2019s usually the stranger dreams or those more closely associated with strong emotions that stick with us. This doesn\u2019t mean to say you constantly need to seek extreme circumstances. But making intentional efforts to occasionally step out of your comfort zone may have an influence here.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<p>Some approaches here can include:&nbsp;<\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<ul><li><strong>Sleeping Outdoors<\/strong><\/li><\/ul>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<p>Getting out into nature is often associated with vivid dreams, with <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/matadornetwork.com\/bnt\/lucid-dreams-and-the-wilderness-effect\/\" target=\"_blank\">camping among wildlife purportedly linked to lucid dreaming<\/a>. There are new sounds, smells, and qualities of light that contribute to your nighttime experiences. As such, finding opportunities to sleep outdoors can help jumpstart more memorable dreams. This doesn\u2019t have to always involve going out into the wilderness, though. It can be practical and fun to plan backyard camping sessions every so often. It\u2019s important to minimise bug presence and turn off automatic sprinklers so your sleep isn\u2019t disrupted. But sleeping beneath the stars wherever you are can influence your dreams for more effective recall.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<ul><li><strong>Learning Something New<\/strong><\/li><\/ul>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<p>Learning and memory are closely linked to one another.
