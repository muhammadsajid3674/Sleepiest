Grumpiness is one of the main side effects as you will probably know. As is a lack of attention and an inability to answer simple questions effectively.<\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<h2>But does sleep deprivation have a profound consequence on your physical health?

Stress, long hours working on computers and taking work home with us are the frequent blame. But the cost of all those sleepless nights does more to your body than you think.

Waking up throughout the night can cause sleep deprivation which in turn can leave you with respiratory infections. If diseases worsen you could be left with chronic lung illnesses.<\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<h3>Digestive System<\/h3>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<p>Much like eating too much and not exercising, sleep deprivation is another risk of becoming obese. Sleep can affect the levels of two hormones; leptin and ghrelin which control feelings of hunger and fullness.<\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<p>Leptin is the hormone that tells your brain that you&#8217;ve had enough to eat. Without a proper nights sleep, your brain reduces leptin and raises ghrelin which is an appetite stimulant. A fluctuation in these hormones could explain why people binge at night or why you may overeat late at the night. A lack of sleep also affects to weight gain by making you feel too tired to exercise.<\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<p>Sleep deprivation prompts your body to release higher levels of insulin after you eat. Insulin controls your blood sugar levels. A higher insulin level promotes fat storage and an increase of being at risk for type 2 diabetes.<\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<h3>Cardiovascular System<\/h3>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<p>Sleep affects the processes that keep your heart and blood vessels healthy. That means that your blood sugars, pressure and inflammation levels are also affected. Sleep plays a vital role in aiding your body&#8217;s ability to repair and heal the heart and blood vessels.<\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<p>One analysis published in the <a href=\"http:\/\/journals.sagepub.com\/doi\/10.1177\/2047487317702043\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">European Journal of Preventative Oncology<\/a> linked insomnia to an increased risk of strokes and heart attacks.<\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<h3>Endocrine System<\/h3>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<p>Hormone production is very much dependent on your sleep. Testosterone production requires at least 3 hours of uninterrupted sleep. Waking up throughout the night affects your hormone production.<\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<p>These interruptions can also affect hormone growth, especially in children and adolescents. Hormones help build muscle mass and repair cells and tissue. The pituitary gland releases growth hormones continuously though sleep and exercise are large players in helping induce the release of this hormone.<\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<h2>What are the benefits of sleep?<\/h2>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sleepiest.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/sleeping-cat.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-839\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.sleepiest.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/sleeping-cat.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.sleepiest.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/sleeping-cat-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.sleepiest.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/sleeping-cat-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<p>Some of these may sound obvious, but there are actually quite a few benefits to a good nights sleep. As mentioned earlier, regular sleep helps build your immune system. It can prevent diabetes, heart disease and strokes.<\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<p>It can also keep you trim and stop you getting overweight.

Disorders such as anxiety and depression are drastically reduced.<\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<p>A good nights sleep also improves your sex drive. Men and women who don&#8217;t get a good nights sleep have lower libidos. Men who suffer sleep apnoea also have lower testosterone which can lower the desire for sex. For women, healthy sleep can increase fertility and lower the difficulty for trying to conceive.<\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<h2>How can you catch up on a loss of sleep?<\/h2>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sleepiest.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/sleeping-peanut.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-840\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.sleepiest.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/sleeping-peanut.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.sleepiest.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/sleeping-peanut-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.sleepiest.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/sleeping-peanut-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<p>If you&#8217;re not getting enough sleep, there&#8217;s only one way really to help \u2013 commit to getting more sleep!

On the weekend allow your body to wake up naturally in the morning without the use of an alarm clock.
