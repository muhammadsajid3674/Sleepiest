We&#8217;ve all seen them, but a lot of us have probably never used one.<\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<h2>Do sleep masks actually work?<\/h2>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sleepiest.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/sleep-masks.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-826\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.sleepiest.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/sleep-masks.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.sleepiest.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/sleep-masks-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.sleepiest.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/sleep-masks-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<p>The brief answer is yes, they do make a difference, but how and why? Don&#8217;t worry, we&#8217;ll get into it. Many of us struggle at night but we&#8217;ve probably never thought to try a sleep mask. Now, I&#8217;ve never tried one as I feel it would be a restriction on my face causing me to itch, a reason most would say. I&#8217;d never tried them till recently and I was wrong.<\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<p>Sure, you could give over-the-counter medication a whirl but it&#8217;s only going to be temporary and can give you unnatural rest. The same can be said for prescription medication. But trust me, nothing is as simple as a sleep mask. It turns out that a lot of us just need a comfortable blindfold to block out the light. Combine that with a good soundscape or sleep story and you&#8217;ll be drifting off in no time.<\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<h2>What are the benefits?<\/h2>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sleepiest.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/block-light.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-827\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.sleepiest.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/block-light.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.sleepiest.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/block-light-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.sleepiest.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/block-light-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<p>The most obvious is that it blocks out the light. It turns out that a lot of us just need a comfortable blindfold to block out the light. The two biggest distractions from trying to sleep are noise and light. Some people can even be kept awake by the rays of moonlight. A sleep mask helps block out the obvious sources of light such as televisions, phones and lamps as well as natural lights like the sun or the moon. Alarm clocks or phone lights with LED lights on them can be a big factor in keeping you up at night.<\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<p>Another benefit is that a sleep mask can actually help protect the skin around your eyes while you sleep. Now, this might sleep like a minor issue, but sleep masks can pay off in the long run. While you sleep, a lot of people tend to push the side or front of their faces into their mattress or pillow. I know I do. Though it might only happen briefly during the night, it can actually leave an imprint on your skin from the wrinkles in your sheets or pillows. Those imprints can stay on your face for hours and eventually leave lasting damage or wrinkles on your face.<\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<h2>Is there anything to watch out for?<\/h2>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sleepiest.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/bear-in-bed.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-828\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.sleepiest.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/bear-in-bed.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.sleepiest.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/bear-in-bed-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.sleepiest.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/bear-in-bed-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<p>It&#8217;s important to make sure you get the&nbsp;right mask for you. It&#8217;s very much a&#8221;three bears&#8221; scenario, some may be too tight, some may fit too loosely and other will be &#8220;juuuuussst right&#8221;.<\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<p>If the mask is too tight, it will cause discomfort in your nose and eye areas. If it&#8217;s too loose, light can seep through and make the mask ineffective. You may want to consider masks with a raised profile. Masks with a raised profile only touch your face in certain places which, in turn, will cause a lot less (if any) discomfort.<\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n\n<\/div><div class=\"st-post-container gutenberg-block\">\n<p><strong>We hope this has been helpful for you all.
